Throughout all versions
- improve debugging and commenting
- refactor when reasonable
- conform all names to Zend naming convention detailed at: http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/coding-standard.naming-conventions.html

0.1.2
- Downloading and Downloaded filters are switched! Downloaded shows torrents in progress and completed ones until next browser refresh; Downloading always shows only completed ones.
- fix Episodes Only config toggle
- remove all NMT support (only supported OS is currently Debian 7.5)
- clean up all the undefined variable PHP notices spewing into the web server error_log
- repair phone.css button bar location so it floats just above bottom edge of screen even when scrolling
- fix New Favorite Last Downloaded Episode: one input field splits into two but doesn't understand SSxEE notation
- prepopulate global default seed ratio in New Favorite
- completely add or completely remove normalizing feature from guess_match() to detectMatch()
- fix annoying bug where browser thinks Cmd is still depressed after switching to browser using Cmd-Tab on Macs
- fix titles when added to Favorites via toolbar button so that episode number is not included in title
- pin the Favorites dialog so that it is easier to manage Favorites in bulk
- strip season and episode data from title when using Add to Favorites button in toolbar
- pin the Feeds tab in the Configuration dialog
- add Feed Title input above each Feed URL
- add config option "Videos Only" beneath "Episodes Only" to only show items with at least one video quality
- Downloading and Downloaded filters are redundant with each other due to progress bar--combine into one filter called Downloads and use color-coding to distinguish downloading from downloaded items
- Transmission filter is redundant with Transmission modal window and Downloading and Downloaded--remove Transmission filter
- fix the filterBar so that it wraps properly when screen is narrow (responsive design, may not be necessary with removal of filters)
- fix feed section header numbers so that they match the number of rows after selected filter has been applied
- if torrent is deleted using contextMenu, the clientButtons delete and trash buttons sometimes don't know about it until the page is refreshed
- how does <li id="id_###"> get its class overridden for downloading/downloaded items and why does clientID not match id when it happens?
- fix Downloaded items staying in Downloading filter (possibly by merging the two filters)
- resolve collision between $torInfo in html.php and torInfo() in tools.php
  - $torInfo has $torInfo['dlStatus'] but torInfo() has status codes
  - fixed typo of $torInfo['clientId'] in html.php
  - removed now-defined but still unused $torInfo['clientId'] in feed_item.tpl
  - fixed infoDiv's display when $torInfo is not set--now displays if $torInfo['dlStatus'] != ''

0.1.3
- fix debug console in web UI
- finish tvDB support (commented out as of initial cloning)
- add Clear Completed Seeding (Downloaded and Seed Ratio Met) to Torrent config panel and rss_dl.php (keeps Transmission clean after seeding complete)
- add toggle to config for local/remote Transmission and disable features like Deep Directories and Watch Directory for remote Transmission

Unassigned, Realistic
- check to make sure that new decimal PV numbering system works throughout entire app
- adding a selected line as a favorite should toggle off the Favorites "heart" button
- harden the filter input against exploits
- replace all global variables
  - $twxa_version
  - $platform
  - $config_values
  - $html_out
  - $debug_output
  - $main_timer
  - $hit
  - $time_start
  - $test_run
  - $matched
  - $config_out
  - $curl_stuff (maybe not, since this is a library)
  - $verbosity
- write test suite and automate tests if possible
- add ability to gunzip torrents coming from some feeds (such as ezRSS.it)
- make the Interface>Font Size actually affect the entire web UI instead of just the Configuration dialog
- refresh button in toolbar can trigger Test Hit downloads just like browser refresh
- separate out the torrents that were direct-downloaded and don't match any favorites from the ones that do match favorites
- fix pop-up playback controls related to Transmission
- improve history system so that flushing the feed cache and deleting torrents does not easily fool torrentwatch-xa into thinking matching torrents must be downloaded again
- if it does download again, honor the seed ratio from the favorite that it matched
- allow user to mark a torrent as the most recent episode downloaded in that season or in every season
- sqlite for caching and history
- delete old episodes that are replaced by REPACK or PROPER
- remove all uses of global
- add auto-refresh of screen after auto-stop is implemented (might already auto-refresh when favorite is matched and starts download)
- some rows split the title across two lines, even though the source code shows otherwise--might be presence of accented characters

Unassigned, Realistic, Unpopular
- 

Dream on!
- add ability to select a torrent and report just that item as having a detection bug (requires move away from GitHub Issues)
- REVAMP EPISODE DETECTION TO USE TORRENT CONTENTS (IF TORRENT CONTAINS ONLY ONE FILE >1MB & <1GB, MUST BE ONE EPISODE), BUT THIS REQUIRES DOWNLOADING EVERY TORRENT FILE IN EVERY FEED
- implement five-star rating system with separate subfolders for each to make watching the best shows first easier
- implement "probation" system for shows that haven't been liked enough to keep (perhaps zero stars out of five)
- sort torrents into resolutions by folder and allow for download of low-res version first, then high-res later, with toggle-able auto-delete of low-res version
- move season and episode pattern matching (regexp) from hardcode to Configuration tab so users can configure them
- make Favorites list cut off by letter, not whole words, and/or make list horizontal scrolling (hard to do)
