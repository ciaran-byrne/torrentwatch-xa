Throughout all versions
- improve debugging and commenting
- refactor when reasonable

0.1.1
- remove all tvDB support (currently disabled anyway, as cloned from TorrentWatch-X 0.8.9)
- remove all NMT support (only supported OS is currently Debian 7.5)
- clean up all the undefined variable PHP notices spewing into the web server error_log

0.1.2
- pin the Favorites dialog so that it is easier to manage Favorites in bulk
- pin the Feeds tab in the Configuration dialog
- add Feed Title input above each Feed URL
- Downloading and Downloaded filters are redundant with each other due to progress bar--combine into one filter called Downloads and use color-coding to distinguish downloading from downloaded items
- Transmission filter is redundant with Transmission modal window and Downloading and Downloaded--remove Transmission filter
- fix the filterBar so that it wraps properly when screen is narrow (responsive design, may not be necessary with removal of filters)
- fix feed section header numbers so that they match the number of rows after selected filter has been applied

0.1.3
- add debug console to web UI
- 


Unassigned, Realistic
- add ability to gunzip torrents coming from some feeds (such as ezRSS.it)
- make the Interface>Font Size actually affect the entire web UI instead of just the Configuration dialog
- refresh button in toolbar can trigger Test Hit downloads just like browser refresh
- separate out the torrents that were direct-downloaded and don't match any favorites from the ones that do match favorites
- fix pop-up playback controls related to Transmission
- improve history system so that flushing the feed cache and deleting torrents does not easily fool torrentwatch-xa into thinking matching torrents must be downloaded again
- if it does download again, honor the seed ratio from the favorite that it matched
- allow user to mark a torrent as the most recent episode downloaded in that season or in every season
- sqlite for caching and history
- delete old episodes that are replaced by REPACK or PROPER

Unassigned, Realistic, Unpopular
- Remove code related to NMT support
- Remove code related to TVDB and TMDB because it was disabled at the time of cloning anyway

Dream on!
- multi-select torrents in feed list and perform single action on entire selection
- implement five-star rating system with separate subfolders for each to make watching the best shows first easier
- implement "probation" system for shows that haven't been liked enough to keep (perhaps zero stars out of five)
- sort torrents into resolutions by folder and allow for download of low-res version first, then high-res later, with toggle-able auto-delete of low-res version
- move season and episode pattern matching (regexp) from hardcode to Configuration tab so users can configure them
