Throughout all versions
- improve debugging and commenting
- refactor when reasonable
- conform all names to Zend naming convention detailed at: http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/coding-standard.naming-conventions.html

Unassigned, Realistic (ordered from easiest to hardest)

- verify the settings and complete their hints in the config panels
- fix mkdir(): Permission denied in /var/lib/torrentwatch-xa/lib/tor_client.php on line 280
- fix Undefined variable: magnet in /var/lib/torrentwatch-xa/lib/tor_client.php on line 218
- clean up and format log output to /tmp/twlog

- add Feed Title input above each Feed URL

- convert all "template" files into real templates like Smarty, etc. Current .tpl files are really just .php files.

- some rows split the title across two lines, even though the source code shows otherwise (soft hyphens)

- add config option "Videos Only" beneath "Episodes Only" to only show items with at least one video quality

- fix New Favorite's Last Downloaded Episode: one input field splits into two but doesn't understand SSxEE notation
- prepopulate global default seed ratio in New Favorite

- strip season and episode data from title and video Qualities when using Add to Favorites button in toolbar
  - completely add or completely remove normalizing feature from guess_match() to detectMatch()

- remove Episodes (pattern matching filter) from Favorites config panel, as it no longer makes sense 

- add toggle to config for local/remote Transmission and disable features like Deep Directories and Watch Directory for remote Transmission
- fix the filterBar so that it wraps properly when screen is narrow (responsive design, may not be necessary with removal of filters)

- fix the showFilter() redefinition from line 89 (torrentwatch-xa.js:106) and out-of-scope (:127)  problems found by JSLint 

- add auto-refresh of list (might already auto-refresh when favorite is matched and starts download)
- if torrent is deleted using contextMenu, the clientButtons delete and trash buttons sometimes don't know about it until the page is refreshed
- adding a selected line as a favorite should toggle off the Favorites "heart" button in button bar and drop-down menu

- repair phone.css button bar location so it floats just above bottom edge of screen even when scrolling
- how does <li id="id_###"> get its class overridden for downloading/downloaded items and why does clientID not match id when it happens?

- fix debug console in web UI

- make the Favorites panel's Update button not close the panel after updating (same behavior as the Delete button)
- make the Feeds panel's Update buttons not close the panel after updating (same behavior as the Delete buttons)
- fix jquery-1.7.1.min.js:4 Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.

- finish new "Serialization" concept as replacement for Episodes (now that print media can be faved)
  - check to make sure that new decimal PV numbering system works throughout entire app
  - remove "range" detection logic from detection engine (assume all preg_match_all() calls find just one match)
  - finish counting batches (Seasons, Volumes, ranges of Episodes, ranges of Chapters, etc.) as "Serialized Items"
  - fix Episodes Only config toggle

- fix annoying bug where browser thinks Cmd is still depressed after switching to browser using Cmd-Tab on Mac OS X

- finish tvDB support (commented out as of initial cloning of TorrentWatch-X 0.8.9)

- replace all global variables with proper parameter passing
  - $twxa_version
  - $platform
  - $config_values
  - $html_out
  - $debug_output
  - $main_timer
  - $hit
  - $time_start
  - $test_run
  - $matched
  - $config_out
  - $curl_stuff (maybe not, since this is a library)
  - $verbosity

- rework History panel (and probably all other panels) so that it resizes according to Responsive Design
- add ability to gunzip torrents coming from some feeds (such as ezRSS.it)
- make the Interface>Font Size actually affect the entire web UI instead of just the Configuration dialog
- refresh button in toolbar can trigger Test Hit downloads just like browser refresh
- separate out the torrents that were direct-downloaded and don't match any favorites from the ones that do match favorites
- improve history system so that flushing the feed cache and deleting torrents does not easily fool torrentwatch-xa into thinking matching torrents must be downloaded again
  - if it does download again, honor the seed ratio from the favorite that it matched
- allow user to easily mark a torrent as the most recent episode downloaded in that season or in every season
- delete old episodes that are replaced by REPACK or PROPER
- browser vertical scroll-bar leaves white region if it pops-out over the feed list; must refresh browser to resize and move feed list's right edge to the left

Dream On! (Highly Unrealistic or Unlikely to Happen)
- harden the filter input against exploits
- sqlite for caching and history
- write test suite and automate tests if possible
- POSSIBLY combine Downloading and Downloaded filters into one, using color-coding to differentiate between states
- add ability to select a torrent and report just that item as having a detection bug (requires move away from GitHub Issues)
- REVAMP EPISODE DETECTION TO USE TORRENT CONTENTS (IF TORRENT CONTAINS ONLY ONE FILE >1MB & <1GB, MUST BE ONE EPISODE), BUT THIS REQUIRES DOWNLOADING EVERY TORRENT FILE IN EVERY FEED
- implement five-star rating system with separate subfolders for each to make watching the best shows first easier
- implement "probation" system for shows that haven't been liked enough to keep (perhaps zero stars out of five)
- sort torrents into resolutions by folder and allow for download of low-res version first, then high-res later, with toggle-able auto-delete of low-res version
- move season and episode pattern matching (regexp) from hardcode to Configuration tab so users can configure them
- make Favorites list cut off by letter, not whole words, and/or make list horizontal scrolling (hard to do)
