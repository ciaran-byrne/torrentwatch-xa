0.1.0

Next Version

Functional changes
IN PROGRESS

- to_check has different meanings--$matched == to_check for items that are dark grey match_old_download, but yellow match_to_check is Waiting state; might be getting eclipsed by match_nomatch logic
- downloading item doesn't show in Downloading list (to reproduce, start a torrent manually, refresh browser. item will be grey in All, show properly with progress in Transmission, but not show in Downloading or Downloaded; clicking download again on the item in All restores the progress bar to All, so there is some state change that occurs)

Code changes
IN PROGRESS

- fix boolean use of detectMatch() now that it returns an array
