torrentwatch-xa
===============

torrentwatch-xa is a fork of TorrentWatch-X with focus on anime fansub torrents that do not have season numbers, only episode numbers and on Transmission as the only torrent client.

In the process of customizing torrentwatch-xa to fit my needs and workflow, I'll:

- fix some bugs
- refactor code
- add some features, mostly UI and workflow improvements
- let some features languish or remove them outright, especially buggy/unreliable portions of the code
 
The end goal is for torrentwatch-xa to do only what it's supposed to do and do it well. Over time, this will mean that broken or aging features related to non-anime torrents will probably be removed rather than repaired. While such features still work, they will remain.
